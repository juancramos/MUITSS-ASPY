Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.'  Mama dabbled a little bit of perfume on my neck then she kissed my cheek And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes as she started to speak She looked at a pitiful shack And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath She said, 'Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick, And the baby's gonna starve to death.'  She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said, 'To thine own self be true.' And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across The toe of my high-heeled shoe It sounded like somebody else that was talkin' Askin', 'Mama, what do I do?' She said, 'Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy, And they'll be nice to you.'  She said, 'Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down. Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down. Lord, forgive me for what I do, But if you want out, well, it's up to you Now don't let me down Now your mama's gonna move you uptown.'

She said, 'Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.'  It wasn't long after that benevolent man took me in off the street And one week later I was pourin' his tea in a five-room hotel suite  I charmed a king, a congressman and an occasional aristocrat And then I got me a Georgia mansion and an elegant New York townhouse flat And I ain't done bad  Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites That would call me bad They criticize Mama for turning me out No matter how little we had  But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin' for nigh on fifteen years Well, I can still hear the desperation in my poor Mama's voice ringin' in my ears  'Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down. Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down. Lord, forgive me for what I do But if you want out well it's up to you Now don't let me down Now your Mama's gonna move you uptown.'

Droppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E.  So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!  And any mutherfucker that disagrees.  Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass.  'Cause I'm a nigga known for havin' a notorious past.  My mind was slick - my temper was too quick.  Now the FBI's all over my dick.   [Eazy E] Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock.  That's when the E jumped off the startin' block.  A 100 Miles from home and ,yo, it's a long stretch.  A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch.  Yeah, back to Compton again.  Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen.  'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time.  Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind.  Runnin' like I just don't care.

[MC Ren] Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose.  Show me on the news but I hate to be abused.  I know it was a set-up.  So now I'm gonna get up.  Even if the FBI wants me to shut up.  But I've got 10 000 niggas strong.  They got everybody singin' my 'Fuck Tha Police' song.  And while they treat my group like dirt,  Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts.  So I'mma run til I can't run no more.  'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score.  I got a urge to kick down doors.  At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls.   [Dr. Dre] Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'.  Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'.  Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it.  So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it.  The number's even - now I'm leavin'.  We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in.  Her and the troops are right behind me.  But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me.   [Eazy E] One more mile to go through the dark streets.  Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet.  But you know I never stumble or lag last.  I'm almost home so I better haul ass.  Tearin' up everything in sight.  It's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight.
