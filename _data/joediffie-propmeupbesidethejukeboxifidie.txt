  Well, I ain"t afraid of dyin", it"s the thought of being dead I want to go on being me once my eulogy"s been read Don"t spread my ashes out to sea, don"t lay me down to rest You can put my mind at ease if you fill my last request   Prop me up beside the juke box if I die Lord, I want to go to heaven, but I don"t want to go tonight Fill my boots up with sand, put a stiff drink in my hand Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die   Just let my headstone be a neon sign Just let it burn in memory of all of my good times Fix me up with a mannequin, just remember, I like blondes I"ll be the life of the party, even when I"m dead and gone   Prop me up beside the juke box if I die Lord, I want to go to heaven, but I don"t want to go tonight Fill my boots up with sand, put a stiff drink in my hand Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die   Just make your next selection, and while you"re still in line You can pay your last respects one quarter at a time   Prop me up beside the juke box if I die Lord, I want to go to heaven, but I don"t want to go tonight Fill my boots up with sand, put a stiff drink in my hand Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die   Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die
