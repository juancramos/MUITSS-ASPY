Agony is the price That you"ll pay in the end Domination consumes you Then calls you a friend It"s a twisted fall  Binds are like steel And manipulates the will To be And it"s hard to see How soon we forget When there"s nothing else left To destroy It"s a useless ploy  Your eyes will see the dawn of the day And the writing on the wall Those words that stare into your soul And to yourself you will befall  It"s domination Pushed into living hell Domination  A now blacked heart Is reaching out in divinity Body suspended by chains over razors And nails It"s a penalty  Each razor a vice And each nail marks demise Of your life Grim construction grows And life played a trick Sealed you in brick by brick "Til your end Forcing you to bend  Your eyes will see the dawn of the day And the writing on the wall Those words that stare into your soul And to yourself you will befall  It"s domination Pushed into living hell Domination
